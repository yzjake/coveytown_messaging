Covey.Town is a remote collaboration tool that provides a virtual meeting space where different groups of people can gather around to meet and socialize, just like in real life. As a team, we are interested in building a main messaging function with lists of sub-features like direct messaging, group chat, global chat, and dynamic social interaction options like blocking, friending, statusing, etc.

Looking at some of the pioneer remote collaboration applications, messaging is one of the essential elements appearing in both individual conversations and group communications, and all the features we are planning to implement can add additional options for Covey.Town users to improve their interaction experience with each other according to different use cases. Such as, users without a microphone can use the direct messaging tool to keep up with their conversations; A group of users in different distanced locations in the town can create a private group chat for ingroup discussion; Participants can filter certain conversations by changing their status or blocking specific users.
